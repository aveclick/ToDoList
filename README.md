# ToDoList
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/062xDUWBdww>
#### Description: ToDoList is a website where you can add, edit and delete notes.
In my project I used <https://getbootstrap.com/> for design solutions.
I created an app named "ToDoApp", a directoty named "ToDoApp" in another directory named "templates". In models.py I described a Task model. 
I also used SQLite for my project.
